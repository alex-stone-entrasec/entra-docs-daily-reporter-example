# Entra Docs Daily Reporter

Daily GitHub Actions report for Microsoft Entra documentation updates in a strict 24-hour window.

The workflow runs at 07:00 Europe/Amsterdam, collects updates from Entra docs sources, and posts a formatted GitHub issue so GitHub notifications can email you updates. When the daily issue already exists, the workflow also adds a refresh comment so the rerun still sends an email notification.

## 1-Minute Quick Start

1. Fork or clone this repository.
2. In GitHub, open **Settings** -> **General** -> **Features** and make sure **Issues** is enabled for the repository.
3. Open **Actions** and run **Entra Docs Daily Reporter** with **Run workflow**.
4. Open the created issue titled `Daily Entra Docs PR Report - YYYY-MM-DD`.
5. Click **Subscribe** on that issue (or watch repo issues).
6. You now receive daily updates through GitHub notification email.

## What You Get

- Strict 24-hour report window (no multi-day section in the issue body)

- Each row includes:
  - Timestamp (Europe/Amsterdam timezone)

  - Commit URL
  - **MS Learn URL** (when document is published to Learn)

## Manual Test

Use this command to trigger a report manually:

```bash

```

Then check the latest run:

```bash
gh run list --workflow "entra-docs-daily-reporter.yml" --repo <owner>/<repo> --limit 1
```

## Customize

- Entra Docs tracked subpages: `ENTRA_DOCS_SUBPAGES`

## Notes

- No SMTP provider is required.
- Delivery is via GitHub notifications, so account notification settings apply.

## Troubleshooting

### `Unhandled error: HttpError: Issues has been disabled in this repository.`

The workflow publishes the report by creating or updating a GitHub issue and comments on existing daily issues to force a fresh notification email. If repository issues are disabled, the run fails at the publish step.

Fix:

1. Open **Settings** -> **General** -> **Features**
2. Enable **Issues**
3. Re-run the workflow

This is currently a **manual** repository setting. It is not something this workflow can reliably automate with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`, because enabling issues changes repository-level settings.
