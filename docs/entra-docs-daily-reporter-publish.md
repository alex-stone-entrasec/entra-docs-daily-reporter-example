### Daily Microsoft Entra Docs PR Reporter

I use a GitHub Actions workflow that runs daily at 07:00 and emails me all newly opened Entra-related docs pull requests.

What I like:

- It catches updates from `MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs` and Azure Docs commits under `articles/active-directory/<subpage>`.
- The report is grouped by subcategory, so I can scan changes quickly.
- The email-friendly Markdown table includes direct links to commits/PRs.

How to adopt:

- Copy workflow and Node script
- Enable issue notifications in GitHub
- Adjust active-directory subpages and tracking settings
- Optionally tweak subcategory rules in `detectSubcategory(...)`

This makes docs change tracking fully automated and easy to share with teams.
